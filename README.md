(My first GitHub repository, a message to the world and myself)

Hello There!

(Insert Obi-Wan Kenobi meme here)

  Good gosh the cringe. I don't really know what to say... I've come so far... I'd first like to thank no one because I'm the one  putting in the effort to type a description about myself while breaking the fourth wall of writing. You're probably wondering how I got here Well it all started back in when I was just a fetus. Alrighty I think this is enoug a description for the GitHub hello-world repository README file. Probably going to edit this as I continue to learn to code for nostalgia purposes.  

¯|_(ツ)_|¯

  Since I'm on a role here I'll continue. Erm, big idealist, minimalist, realist, with that said I'm a dreamer, a reach for the stars kind of guy and never settle for less(I know how that's a bit of an oximoron, but you'd have to meet me to understand). A wise man once said on a movie theatre screen,"Maxmimum Effort." It's my belief that no truer words have ever been spoken. I'm big on efficiency, organization is key, attention to detail better ought to be a religion, and giving up without making use of a fail will only weaken you. I will always do my personal best everything I do even thoug I may not be perfect. I'm big on comedy but that doesn't exclude a time and place for everything. I love social cues, best way to speak to someone without speaking.

  I'll take this moment to reflect on my current future goals, and there's a few of them so buckle up. It's the law. Alrighty so obviously first, get my highschool diploma. Second things second, take the ASVAB(if I didn't do it already in highschool for some reason) get at least 20 points over minimal for Navy, and then enlist in the Navy... yeah, you read that right. While I'm in the U.S. Navy I'll need to go through basic to continue and select a job. I'll most likely go with a job that will push me physically further than I already am at. The reason for that is because of a secret goal I have after I've been in the Navy for a minimal of two years. I don't know exactly when I would like to come out but I think if I'd have my choice it would be somewhere between the age of thirty to  early forties. All the meanwhile I will fill up my spare time with various educations such as follows: continuing to learn myself in the different programming languages that the world of then has to offer, rigorously studying the foundations of the U.S. Legislative ' history, U.S. and global economics, foreign policy, basic philosophy, etc. . If you don't get the idea then oh well, you will eventually.

  Time to break that paragraph off to continue it in this one. Anyway, during all of the time I spend in the U.S. Navy I will be committing myself to those things. Learning code is not the only thing I will attempt to conintue in the Navy, I'm working on a project with a small group of people right now that we plan on growing very slowly, and very steadily. As of this message we're currently almosts five months into this "project" and my main associate and I have had several discussions on plans for said "project." It will be difficult but that is part of the reason I'm hopefully going to be able to use the military for. As much as I organize my time, I will learn more discipline than I currently have. My biggest hope is how my time management skills will increase. Now, I think that's enough, for my goals within the next thirteen to twenty-three years of life.

  With ALL of that said, if there's ANYTHING, I've ever learned in life it's that nothing is ever set in stone(metaphorically of course). I've learned to live life with making these goals and breaking them down in small increments of time, getting smaller and smaller until I'm at the point where I work with what I got each day that goes by... and I think that's something everyone needs to realize.


P.S. I got a long way to go with this stuff...
